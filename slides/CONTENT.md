## What is [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and why should I be using it?

  ## What is it?
]
.right-column[
  Docker **containers** wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that **contains everything needed to run**: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will **always run the same, regardless of its environment**.

  Virtual machines include the application, the necessary binaries and libraries, and an entire guest operating system -- **all of which can amount to tens of GBs**.

  Containers include the application and all of its dependencies --but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system.

  **Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud**.

## `Dockerfile`
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a `Dockerfile`. A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

```shell
docker build -t myimage .
```

```shell
FROM ruby:2.3.1-slim

RUN mkdir /usr/src/people-in-space
WORKDIR /usr/src/people-in-space

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install

COPY . .

CMD ["ruby", "app.rb"]

```

---
## What do we know about our app?

```ruby
require 'json'
require 'sinatra'

set :bind, '0.0.0.0'

def data
  JSON.parse(File.read('data.json'))
end

before do
  content_type :json
end

get '/' do
  data.to_json
end

get '/number' do
  { number: data['number'] }.to_json
end
```
